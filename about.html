                Hi, I’m <strong>James Lyon</strong> — a front-end developer based in <strong>Meridian, Idaho</strong>. I’m passionate about creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences. My foundation is in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and I’m <em>currently expanding my skills</em> with <em>React</em>, <em>Python</em>, and <em>Java</em> to push my projects even further.
                Before transitioning into tech, I spent several years as a <strong>Customer Service Team Lead</strong>, where I honed my <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>problem-solving</strong>, and <strong>communication skills</strong>. That background taught me how to work effectively on teams, stay calm under pressure, and always focus on delivering a great user experience — values I now bring into my development work.
                I’ve also had the opportunity to travel and live abroad in <strong>Medellín, Colombia</strong>, which gave me a global perspective on collaboration and adaptability. Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me <em>cliff diving</em> or exploring new places — <em>always chasing that mix of challenge and adventure</em>.
                I’m excited to bring together my technical skills, creativity, and customer-first mindset to build engaging, impactful web applications.
            </p>
